Short quiz with timer, penalty, and high score, 

# Description

The App is a short, timed quiz, with an ability to chart your high score.
You race against the clock in order to finish within the :60 time limit.
Each second left is a point counted to your score, but wrong answers __can__ penalize you by subtracting 10 points for each.
You begin by clicking Start
You then make your way through by selecting the correct answer and proceeding with the Next button.
Once you have completed all the questions, you are then *presented* your score, and can grace the leader board by inputting your name.

This App was created to excersise my current skillset when applying javaScript to an HTML file.

This App can be easily used on any browser.
The repository can be found here https://github.com/dohmr/teachDontPoint ; which contains the .js .html and .css
The deployed App can be used here https://dohmr.github.io/teachDontPoint/ . 

This was created through creative collaborations with my peers, instruction from... my Instructor. The use of online resources which were numerous!

I encourage any feedback and would love some constructive criticism!
